1. **Check if Java is installed:**
   ```sh
   java -version
   ```

   If Java is installed, this command will display the version of Java. If not, you'll need to install Java.

2. **Install Java (if not already installed):**
   For Ubuntu or Debian-based systems:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install default-jdk
   ```

   For Red Hat-based systems:
   ```sh
   sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
   ```

3. **Find the Java installation path:**
   ```sh
   readlink -f $(which java)
   ```

   This command will give you the path to the Java executable. The installation path is typically something like `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64` for OpenJDK.

4. **Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:**
   Open the `.bashrc` or `.profile` file in your home directory:
   ```sh
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```
   
   Add the following line at the end of the file, replacing `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64` with the actual path you found in the previous step:
   ```sh
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
   export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ```

5. **Reload the configuration:**
   ```sh
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

6. **Verify that `JAVA_HOME` is set:**
   ```sh
   echo $JAVA_HOME
   ```

If you follow these steps and `echo $JAVA_HOME` still does not output the correct path, please provide any error messages or outputs you encountered during the process, and I can help troubleshoot further.
